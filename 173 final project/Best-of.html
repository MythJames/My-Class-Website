     <p class="Description">  This piece of art is my favorite, I've sketched this design into one of my notebooks at home and this class gave me the opportunity to recreate it in a new way. Iv'e always liked dragons and I wanted to redo my sketh and make it look better, so I created this.</p>

     <p class="Description"> This piece was made for the North American International Auto Show, NAIAS. I put this one in the best of because it's another one of the best pieces I made over the year. It's important to this Gallery because I took more time and put more effort into it. It may need more work but where it's at looks amazing.</p>

    <p class="Description">This piece came from the "ways to play" assignment. "spend only 5 min on it" was the topic and this is what i created which im pretty proud of. its simple but detailed enough for me to call impressive for me in 5 min.</p>
